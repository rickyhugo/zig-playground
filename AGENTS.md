# Project Guidelines

## Zig Version

This repository uses **Zig 0.15.x**. Ensure all code is compatible with this version.

## Reference Source Code

The Zig compiler source code is included as a git submodule in the `zig/` directory. Use this as the primary reference for:

- Standard library implementation details
- Compiler internals and behavior
- Idiomatic Zig patterns and conventions
- Built-in function documentation

When answering questions about Zig behavior or implementation details, consult the submodule source code first.
